# Chapter 1: Software Engineering Principles

## Software Design Process

Developing techniques and methodolgy to write software programs include:

*Problem Analysis*: Understanding the nature of the problem to be solved

*Requirements definition*: Specifying exactly what the program must do.

*High- and Low-level design*: Recording how the program meets the requirements.

*Implementation of the design*: Coding a program in a computer language.

*Testing and verification*: Detecting and fixing errors and demonstrating the correctness of the program.
*Delivery*: Turning over the tested progam to the customer or user (or instructor!)

*Operation* Actually using the program.

*Maintenece*: Making changes to fix operational errors and to add or modify functions of the program.

We can go though these steps one by one or concurrently, that should be kept in mind when designing new software.

We use the term *software engineering* to refer to a disciplied approach to the development of computer programs though all of these software life-cycle activities.

>**Software Engineering**: A disciplined approach to the design, production, and maintence of computer programs that are developed on time and within costs estimaes, using tools that help to manage the size and comlexity of the resulting software products.

>*Algorithm*: A logical sequence of discrete steps that describes a complete solution to a given problem computable in a finite amount of time.

## Goals of Quality Software

Quality software is muchr than a program that somehow accomplishes the task at hand. A good program achieves the following goals:

> It works.
> It can be read and understood.
> It can be modified without excruciating time and effor.
> It is completed on time and within budget.

***It's not easy to meet these goals, but they are important.***
