* C++ Plus Data Structures

Taking notes from the book C++ Plus Data Structures by Nell Dale.

## Why from an old book?

Probably the best way to look at old ways but looking for new ways to improve code over time. Will be using other sources to look at ways to complete code and updating using best practicies. Input is welcome.
